<p>Beginning at Level 1. A randomized sequence of symbols will be displayed on screen for a certain amount of time. Users are required to remember the sequence in the exact order as they are displayed. Once the symbols disappear from the screen a countdown timer will begin. Users must simply re-enter the sequence before the time runs out. If successful, users will be awarded with reward chips. Reward chips are won on every level and free plays will be awarded on specific levels. If the level is failed, users will have the option of purchasing life packs (free plays) or reverting back to Level 1.</p>

<P>It’s As Easy As...</P>
