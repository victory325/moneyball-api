                	<p><b><u>Individual Play</u></b></p>

                	<p>Beginning at Level 1. A randomized sequence of symbols will be displayed on screen for a certain amount of time. Users are required to remember the sequence in the exact order as they are displayed. Once the symbols disappear from the screen a countdown timer will begin. Users must simply re-enter the sequence before the time runs out. If successful, users will be awarded with reward chips. Reward chips are won on every level and free plays will be awarded on specific levels. If the level is failed, users will have the option of purchasing life packs (free plays) or reverting back to Level 1.</p>

                	<p><i>Individual Play gives players the ability to win chips and increase their chip count. Collected chips will be used for entry fees when playing Head to Head Matches or Tournament Play.</i></p>

                	<p><b><u>Head To Head Match</u></b></p>

                	<p>Select a game mode, choose a blind entry fee, challenge an opponent, and go head to head against another user for a winner takes all match. All blind entry fee amounts will be funded through user chip count balance. Available for Royal Flush Club Members only.</p>

                	<p><b><u>Tournament Play</u></b></p>

                	<p>Select a tournament mode, choose a blind entry fee, find opponents or create your own tournament, and go head to head against multiple players in a winner takes all tournament match. Tournament play must consist of 4 players. All blind entry fee amounts will be funded through user chip count balance. Available for Royal Flush Club Members only.</p>

                    <p>The goal here...don't fail. Based on the same game format as Individual Play; each/all players will begin at Level 1. Once Level 1 is complete they will then move onto Level 2, then Level 3, etc. The player that lasts the longest without failing wins. Once an incorrect symbol is entered by either player the game is over. The player who is furthest within the game sequence will take home the pot.</p>

                    <p><b>Speed Mode</b></p>

                    <p>The goal...enter as many correct symbols as you can. Each/all players will be given a continuous sequence of symbols for 25 seconds. The player who enters the most correct symbols within the time frame wins. Entering an incorrect symbol does not conclude as a fail or loss, it simply counts as an incorrect. Players must completely fill in each sequence set before another sequence set will be displayed.</p>
