<h3>L.  Choice of law, mandatory arbitration and venue</h3>

	<ol type="1">
	<li>Governing Law and Jurisdiction:
	<p>This Agreement (and any non-contractual disputes or claims arising out of or in connection with this Agreement) are subject to the laws of the state of Colorado, United States of America, without regard to choice or conflicts of law principles.
	Further, you and we agree to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in Colorado to resolve any dispute, claim, or controversy that relates to or arises in connection with this Agreement (and any non-contractual disputes or claims relating to or arising in connection with this Agreement) and is not subject to mandatory arbitration under Subsection 2.1 of this Section L.
	We do not accept any codes of conduct as mandatory in connection with the $BALL application provided under this Agreement.</p>
	</li>

	<li>Arbitration Agreement:
	<p>2.1 Dispute resolution and arbitration:
	You and we agree with each other that any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and $Ball arising in connection with or relating in any way to this Agreement or to your relationship with $Ball as a user of the $BALL application (whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and whether the disputes or claims arise during or after the termination of this Agreement) will be determined by mandatory binding individual (not class) arbitration. You and we further agree that the arbitrator shall have the exclusive power to rule on his or her own jurisdiction, including any objections with respect to the existence, scope, or validity of this Arbitration Agreement or to the arbitrability of any dispute, claim, or counterclaim. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.  THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED.  There may be more limited discovery than in court.  The arbitrator must follow this agreement and can award damages and relief (including attorney fees) according to these Terms and Conditions of Service.  The arbitrator may not award any relief, including declaratory or injunctive relief, benefiting anyone but the parties to the arbitration.  This arbitration provision will survive termination of this Agreement.</p>
	<p>2.2 Exceptions
	Notwithstanding the section above (2.1), you and we both agree that nothing in this Arbitration Agreement will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of our rights, at any time, to (i) bring an individual action in a U.S. small claims court or (ii) bring an individual action seeking only temporary or preliminary individualized injunctive relief in a court of law, pending a final ruling from the arbitrator.  In addition, this Arbitration Agreement doesn’t stop you or us from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies. Such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf (or vice versa).</p>
	<p>2.3 No Class or Representative Proceedings: Class Action Waiver</p>
	<p>YOU AND WE AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.  Unless both you and we agree, no arbitrator or judge may consolidate more than one person’s claims or otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. The arbitrator may award injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim.  If a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this paragraph’s limitations as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court.</p>
	<p>2.4 Arbitration Rules</p>
	<p>Either you or we may start arbitration proceedings. Any arbitration between you and $Ball will take place under the Consumer Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) then in force (the “AAA Rules”), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement.  You and we agree that the Federal Arbitration Act applies and governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision (despite the choice of law provision above).  The AAA Rules, as well as instructions on how to file an arbitration proceeding with the AAA, appear at adr.org, or you may call the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. $Ball can also help put you in touch with the AAA.</p>
	<p>Any arbitration hearings will take place in Fort Collins, Colorado, USA, provided that if the claim is for $25,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted (i) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (ii) through a non-appearance based telephonic hearing; or (iii) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in Fort Collins, Colorado, USA.
	Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.</p>
	<p>2.5 Notice; Process</p>
	<p>A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail, Federal Express, UPS, or Express Mail (signature required), or in the event that we do not have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail ("Notice"). $Ball's address for Notice is: $BALL, LLC, 1601 Pelican Lakes Pt. #201. Windsor, CO 80550. The Notice must: (i) Identify the name, address, and contact information of the party who seeks arbitration; (ii) Describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (iii) Set forth the specific relief sought ("Demand").  We agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or we may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or by us shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any.  All documents and information disclosed in the course of the arbitration shall be kept strictly confidential by the recipient and shall not be used by the recipient for any purpose other than for purposes of the arbitration or the enforcement of the arbitrator’s decision and award and shall not be disclosed except in confidence to persons who have a need to know for such purposes or as required by applicable law.</p>
	<p>2.6 Enforceability</p>
	<p>The arbitrator’s award, if any, shall be enforceable in any court that has jurisdiction over the party against whom the award is made.
	If this Arbitration Agreement is invalidated in whole or in part, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 2.1 shall govern any claim in court arising out of or related to the Agreements.</p>
</li>
</ol>

This Section M (Term and Termination) will be enforced to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law.

<h3>O.  Severability and Waiver:</h3>

	<p>Unless as otherwise stated in this Agreement, should any provision of this Agreement be held invalid or unenforceable by an arbitrator or court for any reason or to any extent, such invalidity or enforceability shall not in any manner affect or render invalid or unenforceable the remaining provisions of this Agreement, and the application of that provision and other provisions shall be enforced to the full extent permitted by law.
	Any failure by $Ball to enforce this Agreement or any provision of this Agreement shall not waive $Ball’s right to do so at any time.</p>

<h3>P.  Assignment and Delegation:</h3>

	<p>$Ball may assign this Agreement, and $Ball may delegate any of its obligations under this Agreement.  You may not assign this Agreement or delegate any of your obligations or responsibilities under this Agreement to anyone.</p>
