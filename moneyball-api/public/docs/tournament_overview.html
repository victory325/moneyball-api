<center><h2>GAME OVERVIEW</h2></center>

<p>Select a tournament mode, choose a blind entry fee, find opponents or create your own tournament, and go head to head against multiple players in a winner takes all tournament match. Tournament play must consist of 4 players. All blind entry fee amounts will be funded through user chip count balance.</p>

<p><b>Game Modes</b> - Survival & Speed</p>

<p><u>SURVIVAL GAME:</u> The goal here...don't fail. Based on the same game format as Individual Play; all players will begin at Level 1. Once Level 1 is complete they will then move onto Level 2, then Level 3, etc. The player that lasts the longest without failing wins. Once an incorrect symbol is entered by either player the game is over. The player who is furthest within the game sequence will take home the pot.</p>

<p><u>SPEED GAME:</u> The goal...enter as many correct symbols as you can. All players will be given a continuous sequence of symbols for 25 seconds. The player who enters the most correct symbols within the time frame wins. Entering an incorrect symbol does not conclude as a fail or loss, it simply counts as an incorrect. Players must completely fill in each sequence set before another sequence set will be displayed.</p>

<p><i>Available for Royal Flush Club Members only. In-App Purchases may be necessary to compete if user chip count balance is not equivalent to desired entry fee selection.</i></p>
