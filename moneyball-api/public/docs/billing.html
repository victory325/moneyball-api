                    <p>Per the rules and regulations defined by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) as it relates to online/mobile skill cash tournaments, $BALL is required to report winnings to the IRS as "Other Income" when a U.S. player reaches/exceeds $600 in Net Winnings at the end of the calendar year.</p>

                    <p>If you have reached/exceeded $600 in Net Winnings at the end of the year, then you will be sent a 1099-Misc form and will be required to declare your Net Winnings when filing a tax return.</p>

                    <p><b>What are Net Winnings?</b></p>

                    <p>The IRS requires $BALL to calculate a player’s “Net Winnings” as the total winnings minus the entry fee’s paid in tournaments where the player has not won a cash prize. Net winnings will continue to increase each time a player wins or receives cash winnings of some sort. This calculation is based solely on user net winnings, not the amount of withdraw transactions made over the course of a calendar year.</p>

                    <p>Net winnings are calculated as your total winnings minus the entry fees for the tournaments that you've won. Entry fees for cash games in which a cash prize wasn't awarded are not calculated in the player's net winnings.</p>

                    <p><b>Example:</b> If you played five tournaments with an entry fee of $5 and won three of them for $20 each, your net winnings would be $45. That is, your total winnings ($60 or three times $20) minus the entry fees for the games won ($15 or three times $5).</p>

                    <p>Unfortunately, we can't provide any guarantees that users will never experience troubles while playing cash tournaments in the $BALL App. There are numerous factors that could cause issues and may be a normal experience for some depending on the strength of their connection.</p>

                    <p>If you encounter a technical issue while playing a cash tournament that affects your ability to successfully play your entry, please contact <a href="#CONTACT">Contact Support</a> requesting a review of the entry and potential refund of the entry fee that was paid.</p>

                    <p>General response time is within 1-2 business days.</p>

                    <p>$BALL cannot be held responsible for issues experienced beyond our control. A refund request may be denied if there is no evidence in the game logs to indicate that the issues experienced were directly caused by a malfunction of $BALL servers.</p>

                    <p>All Entry Fee credits will be awarded in Game Credits, not Real Money. Game Credits can be used to enter additional cash tournaments or head to head matches.</p>
